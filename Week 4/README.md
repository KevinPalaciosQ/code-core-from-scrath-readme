Make a program that asks how many sales the seller had, Once the number of sales is entered, ask for the value of each sale until all are entered, then return as a result the average value of sales, and the commission that the seller will take, If the seller had more than 5 sales, his commission will be 15% of the total value of the sales, if he sold 5 or less, his commission will be only 10%.

	SI totaldeventas < 5 Entonces
		Imprimir "The commission received by the seller is: ", ingresostotales * 0.10
	SiNo
		Imprimir "The commission received by the seller is: ", ingresostotales * 0.15
	FinSi
