to you in order to interact with a REST API as a developer.

   - Is there an alternative to Postman?

## Solution

### Postman only works with REST APIs?
No, Postman can be used to test and work with any kind of APIs, not just REST APIs. Postman supports a wide range of API types including REST, SOAP, and GraphQL, as well as web services using HTTP, HTTPS, and other protocols. In addition, Postman provides a variety of features that make it a powerful tool for testing and working with APIs, such as automated testing, debugging tools, and API documentation generation.

### Is there an alternative to Postman?

- ***Insomnia***: Insomnia is a free and open-source alternative to Postman that is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It offers similar features to Postman, such as request and response history, automated testing, and documentation generation.

- ***Paw***: Paw is a Mac-only API testing tool that is designed to be more developer-focused than Postman. It offers features such as code generation, environment variables, and integrations with other development tools.

- ***SoapUI***: SoapUI is a widely-used tool for testing SOAP and REST APIs. It offers a variety of features, such as test case management, data-driven testing, and security testing.

- ***RESTClient***: RESTClient is a lightweight, open-source tool that can be used to test REST APIs. It is available as a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome.

- ***Advanced REST Client***: Advanced REST Client is another browser-based tool for testing REST APIs. It offers features such as history tracking, automatic testing, and support for multiple authentication methods.
