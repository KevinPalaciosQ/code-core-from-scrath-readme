# APIs Core Understanding

## Description
We are sure you've heard the word API many times before, but do you know what an API is?

Knowing what an API really is will help you understand how important structured communication between two different programs is and what options currently exist to achieve such communication.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

1. What is an API?
2. What is a Protocol?
3. Is the term API only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet?
4. Why is structured communication between two programs important?
   - Do we humans use APIs when communicating without technology?
5. Is an API just another program or a standard?
6. Do you know any API? Can you list at least 5 examples of APIs?

It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of the APIs, so before answering the
questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers
as a group and refine your final answers.

## Solution

### 1. What is an API?
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of guidelines and protocols that allow communication between different software applications. An API defines the types of requests that can be made, the format of the data that should be sent and received, and any authentication or security requirements.

### 2. What is a Protocol?
A protocol is a set of rules and standards that govern the communication between two or more systems. Protocols can be used in a variety of contexts, such as computer networking, telecommunications, and the Internet. Examples of protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

### 3. Is the term API only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet?

No, the term API is not only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet. APIs can also be used for communication between programs on the same machine or within a closed network.

### 4. Why is structured communication between two programs important?

Structured communication between two programs is important because it enables them to exchange data in a standardized and predictable way. This reduces errors and enables more efficient processing of data. We humans also use structured communication when we communicate in a formal setting, such as following the rules of grammar and syntax in written or spoken language.

### 5. Is an API just another program or a standard?

An API is not just another program, but rather a set of guidelines and protocols that enable communication between different programs. It is a standard in the sense that it defines the way that programs should communicate with each other, but it is not a program itself.

### 6. Do you know any API? Can you list at least 5 examples of APIs?

- The Google Maps API, which allows developers to integrate Google Maps into their own applications.

- The Twitter API, which allows developers to access Twitter data and functionality, such as posting tweets or searching for tweets by keyword.

- The Amazon Web Services API, which provides a wide range of cloud-based services, such as storage, computing power, and database management.

- The YouTube API, which allows developers to access YouTube data and functionality, such as retrieving video metadata or uploading new videos.

- The OpenWeatherMap API, which provides weather data for locations around the world.
