# Client-Server Model

## Description

Having a solid understanding of how the communication between a
client and server is carried out will give you greater visibility
of how the web currently works.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

1. What is a Server?
2. What is a Client?
3. Is a server just another physical computer?
   - Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?
   - What is the difference?
4. Is there any similarity between human communication and the client-server model?
   - List some examples
5. Is the client-server model applicable only to the Web?
   - Do desktop applications use the client-server model?
   - Can you mention any other example of this model outside the Web?

It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of the client-server model, so before answering the
questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers
as a group and refine your final answers.

## Solution

### 1. What is a Server?
A server is a computer or a software program that provides services or resources to other computers or programs on a network. The services can range from file storage and sharing, email management, database access, web hosting, and more.
### 2. What is a Client?
A client is a computer or a software program that accesses the services or resources provided by a server. The client can request data or services from the server, and the server responds to the client's requests.
### 3. Is a server just another physical computer?
No, a server can be a physical computer or a virtual machine. A server refers to the role of the computer or the software program that provides services or resources to other computers or programs on a network.

   - ***Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?***
    
We refer to a certain class of applications as servers because they provide services or resources to other applications or computers on a network.

   - ***What is the difference?***

The difference between a server and a client is that a server provides services or resources to other computers or programs, while a client accesses those services or resources from the server.
### 4. Is there any similarity between human communication and the client-server model?

Yes, there is a similarity between human communication and the client-server model. In human communication, one person can request information or services from another person, who then responds to the request. This is similar to the client-server model, where the client requests information or services from the server, which then responds to the client's request. Examples of human communication that resemble the client-server model include asking for directions, ordering food at a restaurant, or requesting help from a customer service representative.

### 5. Is the client-server model applicable only to the Web?
No, the client-server model is not applicable only to the web. Desktop applications can also use the client-server model, where the desktop application acts as the client and accesses services or resources provided by the server. Examples of desktop applications that use the client-server model include email clients, instant messaging applications, and database management tools. Other examples of this model outside the web include online games, remote desktop applications, and file-sharing applications.
