# Node.JS Module System

## Description

Now that you have a clearer concept about what Node.JS is, it's time to practice with one of its most important concepts: The Module System.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

    1. What is a Javascript Module?
    2. Why are Javascript Modules necessary?
    3. What module standards are available in Node.JS?
    4. What are the differences between ESModules and CommonJS modules?
    5. Which types of modules exist in Node.JS?

It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to form your own concept of the module system, so before answering the questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers as a group and refine your final answers.

## Solution

### 1. What is a Javascript Module?
A JavaScript module is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functionality, variables, and data structures. It allows developers to organize and modularize their code into smaller, more manageable units that can be reused and maintained more easily.
### 2. Why are Javascript Modules necessary?
JavaScript modules are necessary to address some of the common issues that arise when writing complex applications, such as namespace collisions, dependency management, and code organization. By encapsulating code in modules, developers can ensure that each module has a clearly defined interface and set of dependencies, making it easier to test and maintain.
### 3. What module standards are available in Node.JS?
Node.js supports several module standards, including CommonJS, ESModules, and AMD. CommonJS is the default module format in Node.js, while ESModules are supported starting from Node.js 12.0.0.
### 4. What are the differences between ESModules and CommonJSmodules?
ESModules and CommonJS modules differ in their syntax, loading mechanism, and module resolution. ESModules use the `import and export` statements to define and export module functionality, while CommonJS uses `require()` and `module.exports`. ESModules have static, top-level imports, while CommonJS allows for dynamic imports. ESModules are loaded asynchronously, while CommonJS modules are loaded synchronously. Finally, ESModules use a new module resolution algorithm that is more flexible than the one used by CommonJS.
### 5. Which types of modules exist in Node.JS?
Node.js supports two types of modules: built-in modules and external modules. Built-in modules are pre-installed with Node.js and can be loaded using the `require()` function. External modules are third-party modules that can be installed using Node.js package manager, npm, and then loaded using the `require()` or `import` function.
