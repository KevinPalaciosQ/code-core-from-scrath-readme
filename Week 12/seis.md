# HTTP Learning Exercise

## Description

Before you can start building Web applications that implement the client-server model, it's important that you know, understand, and can explain why HTTP is such a fundamental technology for the Web.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

1. What is HTTP?
2. What is a Communication Protocol?
   - Do humans use communication protocols?
3. What is a Request in HTTP?
4. What is a Response in HTTP?
5. What is an HTTP method?
6. What are HTTP request headers?

It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of REST, so before answering the
questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers
as a group and refine your final answers.

## Solution

### 1. What is HTTP?
If the Internet is the infrastructure connecting web clients and servers, HTTP is the “language” they speak to each other over that connection. This is how we make web pages load and YouTube videos play.

### 2. What is a Communication Protocol?
A communication protocol is a set of rules and standards that govern the exchange of information between two or more entities. Communication protocols define how data is transmitted, what types of messages can be sent, and how errors are handled. While humans don't typically use communication protocols in their everyday interactions, they do follow certain social conventions and norms that can be seen as analogous to communication protocols.

### 3. What is a Request in HTTP?
A request is the act of formally asking for something. In the context of HTTP, a request is a message sent from a client to a web server that specifies an action to be performed on a resource.

### 4. What is a Response in HTTP?
A response in HTTP is the message sent by a server back to the client in response to a request. The response contains the requested resource (e.g. a web page, image, or video), along with any additional headers or data that may be necessary for the client to properly interpret the response.

### 5. What is an HTTP method?
An HTTP method is a command used in an HTTP request to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. The most commonly used HTTP methods are GET (retrieve a resource), POST (submit data to be processed), PUT (update a resource), and DELETE (remove a resource).

### 6. What are HTTP request headers?
HTTP request headers are additional pieces of information that can be sent along with an HTTP request. Headers provide context and instructions to servers on how to process the request, and can include things like authentication tokens, browser information, and content type. Some common request headers include "User-Agent" (identifies the user's browser), "Accept-Language" (specifies the preferred language for the response), and "Authorization" (provides authentication credentials).
