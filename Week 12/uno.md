# Node.JS Core Understanding

## Description

Understanding well what Node.JS is before starting to use it, will make it much easier for us to work with this powerful tool. In this exercise your task is to answer the following questions in your own words:

1.  What is Node.JS?
    - What is NPM?
2.  What problem does Node.JS solve (Is there any problem that can be solved with Node.JS ðŸ¤”)?
3.  What is the V8 Javascript Engine?
4.  Is Node.JS really necessary in the Development ecosystem?
    - Why not use PHP or Golang?
5.  What is the difference between Node.JS and any other browser?
    - Are Node.JS and a browser the same?
6.  What is NVM and Why is it useful for Node.JS developers?
## Solution

### 1.  What is Node.JS?

Is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Use the V8 Javascript engine of Google Chrome.

- **What is NPM?**

    `Node Package Manager`

    Is a package manager for the Node.js ecosystem. It allows developers to easily install, share, and manage third-party libraries or modules that can be used in Node.js projects.


### 2.  What problem does Node.JS solve (Is there any problem that can be solved with Node.JS ðŸ¤”)?

Node.js was developed to solve a specific problem: the ability to run JavaScript code on the server-side, outside of the web browser.

Traditionally, JavaScript was only used for client-side scripting in web browsers. This meant that developers had to use a separate language for server-side programming, such as PHP, Java, or Ruby.

Overall, Node.js solves the problem of creating highly efficient, scalable, and fast web applications using a single language across the entire stack. 

### 3.  What is the V8 Javascript Engine?

V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome. V8 provides the runtime environment in which JavaScript executes.

### 4.  Is Node.JS really necessary in the Development ecosystem?

Node.js is not strictly necessary, but it is a popular and useful tool in the development ecosystem, especially for building real-time, data-intensive applications. 

Node.js provides a fast and efficient platform for building server-side applications using JavaScript, which can be easier for front-end developers who are already familiar with the language. 

Additionally, Node.js has a large and active community of developers and offers a rich library of modules and tools, making it a versatile and powerful tool for building modern web applications.

- **Why not use PHP or Golang?**

    PHP and Golang are both popular server-side languages and have their own strengths and weaknesses. Both have a long learning curve, while Node uses JS which is a more familiar language for developers.


### 5.  What is the difference between Node.JS and any other browser?

- **Are Node.JS and a browser the same?**

    Node.js is not a browser. It is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser environment. Browsers are designed to display web pages and execute JavaScript code in a sandboxed environment, whereas Node.js is designed to run server-side JavaScript code.



### 6.  What is NVM and Why is it useful for Node.JS developers?

NVM (short for Node Version Manager) is a tool that allows Node.js developers to easily switch between different versions of Node.js on their development machine. NVM allows developers to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js side-by-side, which can be useful for testing and compatibility purposes.
