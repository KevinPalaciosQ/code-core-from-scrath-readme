```
1.	Begin
2.	Buy ingredients
3.	Mix the warm water with the fresh yeast in a bowl.
4.	When you have mixed the yeast with the water, add the two tablespoons of oil. Mix well to integrate all the ingredients for the pizza.
5.	After the corresponding time, sprinkle some flour on a table to prepare the homemade pizza, take one of the balls and place it on it. Now you will have to extend it with your hands stretching it from the center to the sides, giving it a circular shape. If you have a rolling pin you can also use it to make the dough thinner. Once stretched, you can add the homemade pizza sauce and the pizza toppings of your choice.
6.	After the time has elapsed, put the homemade pizza in the oven and bake it for approximately 10 minutes. You should keep an eye on it because the final time will vary depending on the type of oven and its intensity.

# Hot N Cold 🥶 **#2**
```
1.	Begin
2.	Request Temperature and call it Temperature
3.	if the temperature is in degrees  celcius
4.	the formula (32 °F - 32) × 5/9 = °C will be used.
5.	Print the Temperature
6.	if the temperature is in degrees farenheit
7.	the formula (0 °C × 9/5) + 32 = °F
8.	Print the Temperature
9.	End
```
# Geometry 📐 **#3**
```
1.	Begin 
2.	Create a variable called option
3.	Please Choose a Option:
a.	volume of a Pyramid
b.	volume of a Cube
c.	volume of a Sphere
4.	If Option = a then use the formula V=1/3 πr ^2h
5.	Create a variable called r and a variable called h
6.	Get the values of r and h and use in the formula
7.	Print Volume of a Pyramid
8.	If Option = b then use the formula V=Side^3
9.	Creade a Variable called Side
10.	Get the value of Side and use in the formula
11.	Print Volume of Cube
12.	If Option = c then use the formula V=4/3 πr ^3
13.	Creade a Variable called r
14.	Get the value of r and use in the formula
15.	Print Volume of Sphere
16.	End
