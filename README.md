# Pizza Algoritm
## Ingredients:
- [x] 1 kg of strong flour
- [x] 1 teaspoon fine salt 
- [x] 2½ cups of warm water 
- [x] 2 tablespoons of olive oil 
- [x] 1 can of sliced heart of palm
- [x] 1 can sliced pineapple
- [x] 150 cubic centimeters of Tomato Sauce
- [x] 150 grams of mozzarella cheese
- [x] 150 grams of sliced ham
- [x] 1 jar of sauce
- [x] 30 grams of fresh yeast
```
1.	Begin
2.	Buy ingredients
3.	Mix the warm water with the fresh yeast in a bowl.
4.	When you have mixed the yeast with the water, add the two tablespoons of oil. Mix well to integrate all the ingredients for the pizza.
5.	After the corresponding time, sprinkle some flour on a table to prepare the homemade pizza, take one of the balls and place it on it. Now you will have to extend it with your hands stretching it from the center to the sides, giving it a circular shape. If you have a rolling pin you can also use it to make the dough thinner. Once stretched, you can add the homemade pizza sauce and the pizza toppings of your choice.
6.	After the time has elapsed, put the homemade pizza in the oven and bake it for approximately 10 minutes. You should keep an eye on it because the final time will vary depending on the type of oven and its intensity.
7.	End

# Hot N Cold Algorithm
```
1.	Begin
2.	Request Temperature and call it Temperature
3.	if the temperature is in degrees  celcius
4.	the formula (32 °F - 32) × 5/9 = °C will be used.
5.	Print the Temperature
6.	if the temperature is in degrees farenheit
7.	the formula (0 °C × 9/5) + 32 = °F
8.	Print the Temperature
9.	End
```
# Geometry Algorithm
```
1.	Begin 
2.	Create a variable called option
3.	Please Choose a Option:
a.	volume of a Pyramid
b.	volume of a Cube
c.	volume of a Sphere
4.	If Option = a then use the formula V=1/3 πr ^2h
5.	Create a variable called r and a variable called h
6.	Get the values of r and h and use in the formula
7.	Print Volume of a Pyramid
8.	If Option = b then use the formula V=Side^3
9.	Creade a Variable called Side
10.	Get the value of Side and use in the formula
11.	Print Volume of Cube
12.	If Option = c then use the formula V=4/3 πr ^3
13.	Creade a Variable called r
14.	Get the value of r and use in the formula
15.	Print Volume of Sphere
16.	End
```

# Numbers
```
1.	Begin
2.	Ask the number
3.	verify if the number divided by 2 has a remainder
4.	has reminder
a.	print “odd number”
5.	doesnt have reminder
a.	print “even number”
6.	End
```

# How old are you
```
1.	Ask the Date of birth call it “birthday”
2.	calculate what year and date we are in and call it "current".
3.	Result= current date – birthday
4.	print “Result”
5.	End
```
# Find the Treasure
### “All the messages are lies”
### Solution:
```
1. “A” Chest says: “the middle chest has treasure” --> lie --> without treasure
2. “B” Chest says: “All these chest has treasure” --> there will be at least a chest or two with treasures
3. “C” Chest says: “All these chest has treasure” --> a single chest will have treasure, then there will be two treasures.
```
### Answer:
## The A and C have treasures
