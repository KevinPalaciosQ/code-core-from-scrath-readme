Logic problem
Description

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?
Expected output

Identify which student is telling the truth
```
# Solution: 
```
Only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who did not would be lying. 
1. In the first case, if Alice is lying, what the professor says would be a lie.
2. Bob says that at least someone studied
3. If Charlie says that 2 study the previous preposition would be a lie.
Bob is telling the Truth
```
# Which comes first, cereal or milk?
```
Create an algorithm to prepare a bowl of cereal with milk. Represent the result in pseudocode and in a flowchart.
```
# Algoritm: 
```
1. Get a bowl 
2. Put the cereal
3. If you want to add fruits or something else:
  a. Ask for fruit
  b. Put the fruit
  c. Add Suggar or granola
 4. Pour the milk into the bowl
 5. Enjoy
```
# Pseudocode: 
```
If Bowl equals void then:
  add cereal
  add milk in the bowl
 Else
  get bowl, cereal and milk
  put cereal in the bowl and milk, and add some fruit
End
```

# Algorithm game
## Description
```
This will be a fun challenge, you will be playing a game base on simple commands, and the idea is for you to help the squirrel to take the pine cone. For this challenge try to pass the first 15 levels. We wish you all the luck and happy gaming.
P.S. If you like, you can try to do all 27 levels, but following level 15 we will need more programming concepts, maybe you can go back to this challenge later ðŸ˜‰

# Mod
## Description
```
The following description is taken from this source, feel free to read it, this is just a sub-set of the whole post

In computing, the modulo operation returns the remainder or signed remainder of a division, after one number is divided by another (called the modulus of the operation). In this challenge, you are going to learn and practice this arithmetic operator
