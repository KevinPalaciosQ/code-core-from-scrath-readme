Logic problem
Description

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?
Expected output

Identify which student is telling the truth
```
# Solution: 
```
Only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who did not would be lying. 
1. In the first case, if Alice is lying, what the professor says would be a lie.
2. Bob says that at least someone studied
3. If Charlie says that 2 study the previous preposition would be a lie.
Bob is telling the Truth
```
# Which comes first, cereal or milk?
```
Create an algorithm to prepare a bowl of cereal with milk. Represent the result in pseudocode and in a flowchart.
```
# Algoritm: 
```
1. Get a bowl 
2. Put the cereal
3. If you want to add fruits or something else:
  a. Ask for fruit
  b. Put the fruit
  c. Add Suggar or granola
 4. Pour the milk into the bowl
 5. Enjoy
```
# Pseudocode: 
```
If Bowl equals void then:
  add cereal
  add milk in the bowl
 Else
  get bowl, cereal and milk
  put cereal in the bowl and milk, and add some fruit
End
```
